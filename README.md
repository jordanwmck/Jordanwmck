# Hi, I'm Jordan Mckenzie

## Im a student.
I am studying HNC Computing (Software Development) at West College Scotland, I love technology, designing things and writing code.

## My current focuses are
- **Java 8**: Continuing to enhance my skills and potentially learning modern Java as well.
- **Kotlin**: I have learned the fundamentals in my college course and want to continue my studies.
- **Web Dev**: I have learned the fundamentals of HTML and CSS in my course and [my site](https://jordanwmckenzie.com/) is an example of what I've learned during my course
- **Figma**: I have learned how to make prototypes in Figma in my college course

## I want to learn
- **C++**: This language is the backbone of modern computing and would vastly improve my ability to develop cross-platform applications.
- **Swift and Swift UI**: I mainly use apple platforms so learning more advanced features would be vastly beneficial to me.

## My favorite language is
- **Java 8**: I like Java's syntax and flexibility.

## My least favorite language is
- **Python 2 and 3**: I find the syntax annoying and dislike how the language is structured.

## Interested in my projects?
I would love it if you would follow me on GitHub and Facebook.
