# Hello!
I'm Jordan and I am studying HNC Computing (Software Development) at [West College Scotland](https://www.westcollegescotland.ac.uk), I love technology, desinging things and writing code.

### My primary focus now is
- Java 8: Contuinuing to enhance my skills and potentially learning modern Java as well.
- Kotlin: I am expanding my knowlege of this language in my college course.
- HTML and CSS: This has been something new for me since I started learning at WCS, I want to continue learning web development related topics.

### I want to learn
- C++: This language is the backbone of modern computting and would vastly improve my ability to develop cross-platform applications
- Swift and Swift UI: I mainly use apple platforms so learning more advanced features would be vastly beneficial to me

### My favorite language is
- Java 8: I like Java's syntax and flexability
### My least favorite langage is 
- Python 2 and 3: I find the syntax annoying and dislike how the language is strucutred
